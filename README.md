Problem statement for which this repo has been developed can be found in the assignment1.pdf file.

This repo contains the implementation of the Vanila BackProp Algorithm for training deep neural nets. We have used the EMINIST Dataset in this project. The problem under consideration is of multi-class classification. Only nine classes of letters have been used in this problem. We first filtered out the images for these nine-classes to prepare our training set.

backprop.py also includes code for visualising the training and test errors with different values of the hyperparameters. We have provided implementations using different kinds of activation functions and also implemented different regularisation techniques like L!, L2, dropout etc.

We haven't used any exisiting deep learning libraries for this assignment.
